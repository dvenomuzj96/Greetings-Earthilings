Greetings,

I've done some coding before, but I have yet to fully immerse myself into it like I aim to do this time around. 
At the moment I'm working at an AT&T store and its cool, but I want control over my time. Again. See, I used to
be the manager of a store in Maryland...i'll tell you more later.
