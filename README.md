Greetings,

I've done some coding before, but I have yet to fully immerse myself into it like I aim to do this time around. 
At the moment I'm working at an AT&T store and its cool, but I want control over my time. Again. See, I used to
be the manager of a store in Maryland. It took some adjusting, but I finally understand what it takes. True, people have different motivations and different 
tactics to get their point across, but at the end of the day, its all about helping people grow.

In truth, the most important aspect for me is to control how I spend my time. Second is how much money I can make. There are days when I 
feel like I have done enough for the day, and I want to step off to give others room to grow. Then there are times when I want to just grind and grind.
