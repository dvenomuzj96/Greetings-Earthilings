Greetings,

I've done some coding before, but I have yet to fully immerse myself into it like I aim to do this time around. 
At the moment I'm working at an AT&T store and its cool, but I want control over my time. Again. See, I used to
be the manager of a store in Marland. It took some adjusting, but I finally understand what it takes. True, people have different motivations and different 
tactics to get their point across, but at the end if the day, its all about helping people grow.
